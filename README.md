# Sputnik

Sputnik is a family of software originally developed as an add-on for the Dell
XPS 13 Developer edition (aka Project Sputnik)

This rubygem provides the main `sputnik` command and a framework for extending
it with plugins.

Currently, there are three plugins:

* [sputnik-example][1] (example with documentation for writing your own plugins)
* [sputnik-profile][2]
* [sputnik-cloudlauncher][3] (manages infrastructure with Chef)

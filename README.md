# Sputnik

Sputnik is a family of software originally developed as an add-on for the Dell
XPS 13 Developer edition (aka Project Sputnik)

This rubygem provides the main `sputnik` command and a framework for extending
it.

Currently, there are two extensions:

* [sputnik-profile][1]
* [sputnik-cloudlauncher][2]
